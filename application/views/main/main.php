<p>When attending a doctor’s appointment, a large portion of time is consumed figuring out what symptoms the patient is experiencing. Every time a person goes to their doctor’s appointment, they experience the same redundant process, which usually involves being asked a bunch of questions. This system is broken and can lead to many miscommunication problems.</p>
<p>This project addresses these problems by developing a Sexual, Viral, and Respiratory Disease Recognition System (SVR-DRS) designed to specifically tackle and solve the many issues found in the gathering information process within a doctor’s appointment.</p>
<p>This project will aim at creating an expert system towards getting crucial information from the patient prior to the appointment or during the appointment if prior is not possible. This will create a system where patients can be comfortable describing their symptoms via text, if they are not comfortable saying it in person. </p>
<p>It will also focus on shortening the amount of time spent gathering personal information (such as symptoms, medical history, and other information) from the patient. Based on patient symptoms that are entered it will also propose possible diagnosis to shorten the time spent in making the diagnosis. (Note: This is not a permanent diagnosis, but more of a pointer to a starting point for the doctor.)</p>
